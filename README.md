## Ajax Assignment

I am currently a student in the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. After covering the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript we are now completing our week 7 assignment. For this assignment we are tasked with using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of our choosing.

I hope you enjoy checking it out.

### Here's how the site should work:

1. Choose a theme or topic. 

2. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

3. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

4. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

5. The user input box should take an input form the user and adds it into your array of gif images. Then creates a new button featuring that user input to add to the already existing buttons.
